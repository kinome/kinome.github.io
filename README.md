tl;dr -- Put your static content into the `public_html` folder.

This app is currently configured to use Nginx to serve static content on
Heroku. I haven't really figured out the configuration file stuff yet, but
that's mostly because I haven't spent much time configuring Nginx recently.

I would really like to know if you optimize the configuration, especially if
you add third-party Nginx modules or anything, because this is the same
configuration I am currently using for http://seanwilkinson.herokuapp.com :-)
